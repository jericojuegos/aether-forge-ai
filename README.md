# AetherForge AI ☄️

**AetherForge AI** is a high-performance, generative 3D visualization studio that transforms natural language prompts into immersive, real-time 3D environments. Built for the modern AI era, it leverages the power of Google Gemini to give developers and artists intuitive control over complex procedural geometries, fluid simulations, and particle systems.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Prompt-to-Scene**: Effortlessly switch generators and manipulate 3D parameters using natural language (powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash).
- **High-Fidelity Generators**: Includes procedural planet shaders, real-time fluid dynamics, and pulsing neural networks.
- **Triple-Platform Export**: Instantly generate production-ready code for **React (Three Fiber)**, **Vanilla Three.js**, and **WordPress**.
- **Interactive Previews**: Real-time rendering with OrbitControls and custom GLSL shaders for zero-latency feedback.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, Three.js, @react-three/fiber, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS.
- **AI**: Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro/Flash) SDK integration.
- **Backend Architecture**: Secure API key management (Client-side memory + ready for Express proxying).
- **Core Logic**: Custom GLSL shaders, Procedural noise algorithms.
